## Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Git Page

I am hammad From Australia, a passionate software developer. With a keen eye for clean, efficient, and scalable code, Iâ€™m constantly exploring new ways to build robust applications.

ðŸ”§ Technologies I work with:
.NET for backend development
React for building dynamic user interfaces
